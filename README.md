# Customer Churn Prediction 📉

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts customer churn (the likelihood of a customer leaving a service) using machine learning models.  
It helps businesses identify at-risk customers early and apply retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saipraveen-k/Customer-Churning-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churning-Prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
